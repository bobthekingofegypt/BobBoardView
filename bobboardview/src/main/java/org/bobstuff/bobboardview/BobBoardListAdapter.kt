/**
 * Abstract class for a ListAdapter in a board.  This is more than just a contract it contains some
 * default behaviour that is required for the BobBoardView instance to work.  If you chose to override
 * any of the default function implementation make sure to call the super implementations aswell.
 *
 * ----------------------------------
 * | column A | column B | column C |
 * | ------------------------------ |
 * | row 1a    | row 1b    | row 1c |
 * | row 2a    | row 2b    | row 2c |
 * | row 3a    | row 3b    | row 3c |
 * | row 4a    | row 4b    | row 4c |
 * |--------------------------------|
 *
 * isCardAddedDuringDrag logic:
 * ----------------------------
 * In a BoardView a list is the recyclerview that is part of a column and the ListAdapter is the
 * RecyclerView adapter that manages the rows.  Because a board view is in essence a RecyclerView of
 * recycler views and you can drag entries from one recyclerview to another we need some custom event
 * handling to understand when that happens.  Here we are using a flag isCardAddedDuringDrag and the
 * recyclerViews own callback to tell us when a new ViewHandler has been added to get access to the
 * view handler reference once it is onscreen.  So the steps will be:
 *  - subclass adds model to adapters data representation
 *  - subclass call setIsCardAddedDuringDrag
 *  - subclass notifies the adapter that the data has changed, notifyItemInserted if you want animation
 *  - recyclerview will work out how that needs to be drawn triggering the create and bind as necessary
 *    inserting the a new viewholder and adding it to the window before calling onViewAttachedToWindow
 *    to let us know that the view will be show
 *  - we use this call to check if it was a drag added call and if it was we tell the class registered
 *    for cardEventCallbacks (usually the DefaultCardEventCallbacks that has a reference to the BoardView
 *    through the board adapter, its hard to safely maintain a reference to the boardview here in the
 *    list adapters so I don't try).
