BobBoardView
=============

An android library to try help in creating scrum type board views in android applications.  

## Caution

Do not use this library unless you really know what you are doing.  This is a first draft creation for a toy app I am building to learn kotlin and android.  I build this as an investigation into what is required to create a separate library with gradle.  It is the first thing I have built in android for a while and the first thing I've ever done in Kotlin; so I am pretty rusty.  
I intent to continue to update it as I build the toy app but currently I can't attest to its stability and I may just change the whole API on a whim if I realise it is not right for what I am doing.
